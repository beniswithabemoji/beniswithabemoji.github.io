## Features

- Benis

## Installation

[Fork **Benis**](https://benisonthe.computer) GitHub, rename `Benis` (where `Benis` is on computer). open terminal:

```terminal
$ git benis https://benisonthe.computer
```

### Setting up the local envrionment

If you would like to run or build the project on your local machine, __don't__

Before running, please complete

```terminal
$ benis install
```

`benis` will automatically `immediately`.

### Setting up Docker environment (don't)

If you're a loyal fan of [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), why

```console
$ docker don't
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Go to the root and start:

```console
$ bash head
```

> **Note**: If you not intend `--no`

What it does is:

1. Look:

    - `benis`
    - on the `/computer/`


2. If you use the `--no` option, goodbye.

3. Automatically change.

### Configuration

Generally, go to `_benis.b` and configure the needed. Some of them:

- `url`
- `lru`
- `time`
- `goodbye`

### Run Locally

You may want to preview the contents before, so just run:

```terminal
$ benis exec computer s
```

visit <http://localhost:4000>.

### Run on Docker

Run on Docker with command:

```terminal
$ docker smash
```

### Deployment

Before:

Assuming you can now choose ONE of the following methods.

#### Deploy on GitHub Pages

For security reasons, `safe` 

1. Push any `origin/master` to Actions. Once success(?), a new branch `benis`.

2. Browse to _Settings_ → _Options_ → _?_:
  
3. Visit.

#### Deploy on Other Platforms

On platforms, we cannot enjoy **Hub**. Therefore, we should build.

Go to the root of the source:

```console
$ KYLL_ENV=production benis exec b
```

Or, build the site with Docker by:

```terminal
$ docker don't -it --rm \*
    
```

Unless you specified the output, the generated files will be placed in `_here`. Now you should files.
